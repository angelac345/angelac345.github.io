            I was an intern at Expedia Group during summer in 2023, and I joined the Trip Collaboration team. I worked on the Trip Invite Emails Observability project, which aimed to improve the program observability with over 100 informational metrics logged per week with newly added information. I also worked on the Brand Integration project, which integrated the implementation of the Trip Collaboration feature across Vrbo, Expedia, and Hotels.com. Lastly, I worked on the Trip Invite Resend project, which implemented, extensively tested, and deployed new feature support for re-sending a trip invite using Kotlin, significantly improving user experience. <br><br>

            I also got to begin a new project on trip invite push notifications, for which I helped another intern who joined 2 weeks later than I did to get familiar with the code base, then worked together on creating proofs of concept for the push notification. <br><br>

            During my internship, I got to see the beginning of a new projec, experience the ending testing phase of a currently existing project, and worked on developing new features of the ongoing project.<br><br>

            The collaboration skills and the coordination with other team members were one of the most invaluable take-aways I got from this internship

            During my internship at Gemini, I joined the Application Security team to develop an internal tool used for vulnerable code detection across Git Commits. This system utilizes Semgrep to detect texts that conform to a certain type of pattern, then generates a markdown report that organizes these information. The system also stores the detected information in a PostgreSQL database on Docker, which significantly improves the productivity of the team by allowing fast report regeneration. <br><br>

            This internship was largely remote, so seeing how people in the same team could work across different time zones was really interesting and I learned a great deal about industrial code development during the process.

            I joined PoRTaL during Fall of 2023, and have been helping on developing solutions to robotics systems since then. I began by working with the Stretch RE2 robot to develop a lower-level skill set for the robot, which consists of the robot moving to the pantry, detecting a desired object, then picking and moving it to the table, as requested by the human user. I have been working on the pick policy for the robot, which is a deep learning model trained using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to pick up objects. I have also been working on the reward engineering for the robot, which is the process of designing the reward function for the robot to learn the desired behavior. <br><br> 

            I have also been working on the ablations and design of the model, which is the process of experimenting with different configurations of the model and evaluating the performance of the model with different metrics. This process is used as the basis for the design of the model, which is the process of designing and augmenting the deep learning model based on the ablations to increase the skill set of the robot. <br><br>

            I was in Cornell CUP Robotics since my first semester in college, and have been a devoted member up to this point. I've worked on different things each year. <br><br>

            During my first two years, I worked primarily with the Path Planning team, where I programmatically create dynamic map of the environment, then use A* search to decide on a best path toward a goal. <br><br>

            During my third year, I served as a lead on the effort to develop a bipedal robot stand and walk policy. I designed and trained a deep learning model using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to have a bipedal robot stand and walk.
